# ReceiptReader

This is a playground for recognizing receipts. Right now it only supports receipts from Jumbo supermarkets in Netherlands.

There are prebuild opencv, leptonica and tesseract libraries for Linux and MacOS. OpenCV java bindings are also bundled

You may need to install tesseract to use demo.
